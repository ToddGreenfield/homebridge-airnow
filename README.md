# Homebridge-airnow
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/homebridge-airnow.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-airnow)

Air Quality Index Sensor Plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)
This plugin allows you to monitor your current AirQuality from HomeKit and Siri.

Currently supports two AQI Services:
1. [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov) which is limited to the USA. A valid ZipCode is required.
2. [Aqicn](https://www.aqicn.org) which has international support, provided by the [World Air Quality Index Project](http://waqi.info/).

Depending on where exactly you would like to monitor AQI, one service may be more appropriate than the other.

## Installation
1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-airnow`
3. Update your configuration file like the example below.
4. Ensure you have either an AirNow.gov or Aqicn.org API account to use that web service and have a valid API_KEY for that web service.
For assistance visit - https://docs.airnowapi.org/faq or http://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/#/.

This plugin will create an AirQualitySensor element. The Home app works well, but the Eve app seems to show more measurements. Measurements retrieved are PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, CO.  

## Configuration

```js
